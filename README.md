# Blood Mage

A stranger, in a strange land...
Introducing the Blood Mage, a powerful magician who focuses on spending the life force of herself and her enemies to deal massive damage.

Her kit is based around the idea that some of her skills spend health, adding the spent amount to the skill's base damage. This in turn increases her damage further by her passive skill, which increases her damage by up to 50% based on how much health she's missing. Playing with this kit entails balancing her passive with the need to not be instantly killed by the myriad threats of Petrichor V.

## Skills

### Passive NOT IMPLEMENTED - Coming Soon!
Pain Attunement: You deal more base damage based on how damaged you are, starting at 0% increased damage at full health and rising to 50% at 1 HP.

### Primary
Blood Bolt: Hold to channel your life force into the attack, then release to fire a blood beam, dealing damage based on how much HP was channeled into it. Siphons 15 HP/s (increases with difficulty), and deals 200% damage, with the life spent added to the base damage of the skill.

### Secondary
Essence Sap: Attach a leech to an enemy, siphoning their life force to heal yourself (skill must be channeled). Deals 10% of your maximum HP to the target, and heals you for that amount.

### Utility
Petrified Blood: Reduces your health to 50% of your maximum, and prevents you from healing over 50%. Grants a buff which causes 40% of damage from hits to be taken instantly, and the other 60% is dealt as damage over time. Damage over time effects are not mitigated by this buff.

### Special
Doom Desire: Apply a debuff to yourself and the target. Damage you take during the debuff's duration is stored. At the end of the debuff's duration, the target explodes for 1000% of the stored damage.



More skills are planned for the future. It is also worth noting that no models, effects, or sprites have been added yet. Also, the Passive hasn't been implemented as it requires the existence of the survivor code.
